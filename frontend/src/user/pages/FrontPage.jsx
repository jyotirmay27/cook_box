                                        You can book your "appointment with doctor", where patients are able to communicate directly with their doctor, they may feel more engaged in their own healthcare and more invested in the outcome of their treatment. This can lead to better adherence to treatment plans and improved outcomes. Doctor counseling can be done remotely, which can increase access to healthcare for patients who may not be able to travel to a physical appointment. This can be especially important for patients with mobility issues or those who live in rural areas.

                                        You can "order a recipe" which you can cook at your home. When cooking at home, you have control over the ingredients and can choose healthier options, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. This can help you create healthier meals that are lower in calories, saturated fats, and sodium. Cooking at home can also be a fun and bonding activity for families. It provides an opportunity to work together, try new recipes, and share meals together, which can strengthen relationships and create lasting memories.

                                      You can "rate as you want" on the last orders.
